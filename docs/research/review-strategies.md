# Proposal: Named Review Strategies

This document proposes the missing product layer: **one named, selectable review pipeline per launch**, Convoy-shaped but findings-preserving. It is a design, not an implementation plan.

Status: **DEFERRED — future work.** Written 2026-08-18. **Do not implement on the launch / DoorDash track.** Roadmap: After layer in `ROADMAP.md`. Informed by Convoy (`~/Desktop/convoy`, notes in `../deep-review/intel/convoy.md`).

**Frozen this session (Juanma, 2026-08-18):** document it, do not build it now. Obstacle 1 (no registry) is acceptable missing work and sorteable later. Obstacle 3 (closed hunter enum) is a coordinated C2 bump, not a veto — security / React / clean-code hunters are desired. Obstacle 2 (typed findings vs markdown bus) is why this engine exists; a full markdown migration is possible as a later product call; hybrid (keep JSON contracts, attach prior markdown as context) is the only migration that still emits `findings[]`. Per-pipeline, per-step models are in scope when this lands. One launch = one named pipeline.

## Decision Summary

| Area | Decision |
|---|---|
| Goal | Approach Convoy’s named pipelines without turning pr-hero into a free workflow engine |
| Invariant | Every review pipeline **must produce findings**. ≥1 hunter. Scout-only is illegal |
| Unit of choice | One **pipeline** per launch (Convoy: `-p`). Never two in one run |
| What we copy from Convoy | Named recipes that coexist; a step list as data; `parallel` for hunter fan-out; fail-loud resolve; frozen plan; selector later |
| What we refuse from Convoy | Markdown as the currency between steps; LLM merge instead of `dedupe.ts`; `reports: all` feeding anything to anything; writable agents in a review; nesting parallel |
| What a pipeline is | A named list of **kinded** steps (`scout`, `hunter`, `refuter`, `summarizer`) plus engine glue that is **not** declared |
| Engine glue (never a YAML step) | Gotchas fail-loud, mechanical dedupe, `deriveTier`. Skipping them cannot be expressed |
| Hunter vs scout | Distinct pipelines. Scout is a kinded step that **biases** hunters, not a findings engine |
| Prompt sets | Independent of pipeline id. `--agents` still wins. Fingerprint recorded separately |
| Default | Byte-identical to today’s CLI: `localReviewSpec()`, scout off |
| Models | First-class per step, per pipeline. Hunters opus in A, grok in B; refuter sonnet — that is a pipeline fact, not a global flag |
| How we don’t break it | Closed kind enum + a resolver that rejects illegal graphs (Convoy’s `checkPipelineResolves` idea) |
| Refactor | None of isolation flags or schema. Additive registry, then a kinded list. `execute()` gains a resolver, not a DAG interpreter |

---

## Problem

pr-hero already runs one pipeline per launch. It does not have a **name** for which pipeline, and it does not let you declare a new one as data.

Convoy does. `hunter`, `review`, `ultra-refine`, `implement` are TS/YAML literals. You pick with `-p`. A project file can add or shadow one. That is the flexibility this doc wants, scoped to **reviews that still emit `findings[]`**.

Copying Convoy blindly would break us: their steps pass markdown files into the next LLM; merge is a judge prompt; there is no schema, no `deriveTier`, no isolation-as-threat-model. We need their *registry and step list*, not their *currency*.

---

## Obstacles (three different kinds — don’t mix them)

There is no single wall. Mixing them is how this looks “impossible.”

### 1. Absence — we never built Convoy’s product layer

Nothing in the runner forbids named recipes, per-step models, or picking one pipeline per launch.

| Missing piece | Where |
|---|---|
| No pipeline registry | CLI always calls `localReviewSpec()` (`cli.ts`) |
| No `-p` / `--strategy` | flags are `--scout`, `--agents`, `--model` instead |
| `execute()` does not read a step list | the occupancy is hardcoded: scout → hunters → dedupe → refuter |
| Scout / summarizer are `PipelineInput` flags | not entries in `ReviewSpec` |

**This is the obstacle for “choose hunters-opus vs scout-led vs grok hunters.”** It is solved by adding a registry, not by changing how findings work. `AgentSpec.model` already exists.

### 2. Contract — the engine is a typed state machine, Convoy is a file bus

Convoy step: run a prompt → write `reports/<step>.md` → the next prompt attaches those files. Any agent can follow any agent. Merge is another prompt (`hunter-report`).

pr-hero step: run a prompt → **parse a typed object** → only that type may enter the next *code* stage.

```text
hunter  → HunterDraft     → (code) mergeAndDedupe
refuter → RefuterOutcome  → (code) deriveTier
scout   → ScoutLead[]     → string block on the hunter prompt
                          → never findings[]
```

`execute()` is not an interpreter of “whatever the YAML said next.” It is the only place those arrows exist. That is why a Convoy `reports: all` graph cannot be dropped in: there is no socket that means “this markdown becomes a finding.”

**Why we did it this way** (not taste — consumers and paid failures):

- **Tiers are code.** Blocking vs advisory is `deriveTier` over fields. A markdown paragraph cannot block a merge unless another LLM (or a brittle parser) re-derives the same decision. The AudioTrimmer incident is why severity/evidence/verdict live in data: a prompt-only filter left the refuter idle on 26/26 blocking findings.
- **The lab scores structure.** `findings.json` is byte-talk with `deep-review`’s validator and scorer. Path, line, hunter, claim, `dedupe_key` are how a miss is attributed. Markdown has none of that unless we compile it back into the same schema — at which point we still have obstacle 2, just later.
- **The driver owns writes.** Agents cannot Write. The JSON object is what the runner `parse`s before anything hits disk. A “visible output is the report” Convoy step skips that gate.
- **Isolation and attribution.** The driver stamps `hunter` on every draft. A self-reported name in prose is how attribution dies.

**Is a markdown migration possible?** Yes. It is a product migration, not a flag.

| Move | What you get | What you pay |
|---|---|---|
| **Full Convoy bus** | Any step feeds any step via files | New merge, new “what is a finding”, new comparison/ledger/scorer, or those tools go away |
| **Hybrid (recommended if we move)** | Keep the JSON contract at hunter/refuter/scout. Optionally attach prior step markdown as *context* (scout leads already do this) | Authoring looks more like Convoy; findings stay typed |
| **Stay** | Current guarantees | Step list must be kinded so it only expresses this machine |

Full markdown is viable in the same sense Convoy is viable: you are building their product. Hybrid is the only migration that does not throw away `findings[]`.

### 3. Schema lock — hunter keys are a closed enum (C2)

This is **not** a philosophy that forbids security / React / clean-code hunters. Those specialties are exactly what C2 is for, and they are a good reason to do the bump.

What C2 actually is: a **coordinated v1.1** so four copies of the enum stay in sync (`src/findings.ts` type + runtime `HUNTERS`, `src/spec.ts` `SCHEMA_HUNTER_KEYS`, and the lab mirrors in `deep-review/runner/findings.ts`). Until that bump, a finding with `hunter: "security"` fails validation on both sides and old artifacts/scorer rows disagree with new ones. Rule 5 is lab compatibility, not “we will never have more hunters.”

**Sorteable, with a bump, not a rewrite:**

- New keys (`security`, `react`, `clean-code`, …) → open the enum both repos, migrate the validator, then those hunters are just `AgentSpec` entries in a pipeline.
- Dual-model *same* key in one run (`reliability` on opus and grok) → still needs a second key (`reliability-b` or a `models: []` field) plus a merge rule: two copies of the same prompt agreeing is **not** independent corroboration (`ROADMAP.md` C2). That rule is the real design work; the enum is the mechanical lock.

DoorDash’s warning is separate: **do not use “more specialists” as the definition of a deep review.** Having a React hunter is fine. Assuming depth = fan-out width is what they measured and abandoned.

The earlier write-up overstated this as an impassable wall. It is a version gate. It should not block designing named pipelines that will grow new keys the day C2 lands.

A related but smaller lock: putting scout *inside* `ReviewSpec.role` would re-fingerprint the prompt set (M6’s one-variable rule). Scout stays a pipeline slot outside the agents dir — same as today — so this does not block named pipelines.

### What to solventar vs what to keep

| If the idea is… | The real obstacle | Move |
|---|---|---|
| Pick / create recipes, pin models | **#1 Absence** | Registry + selector. Sorteable now |
| Security / React / clean-code hunters | **#3 Schema** | C2 bump both repos. Sorteable; not a veto |
| Same hunter, two models, one run | **#3** + merge semantics | C2 + an explicit corroboration rule |
| Markdown instead of typed findings | **#2 Contract** | Possible as a product migration; hybrid if we still want `findings[]` |
| Any step wired to any step | **#2** | Kinded list + resolver, or full Convoy (see table above) |

---

## What Convoy actually is (so we copy the right thing)

A Convoy pipeline is **sequential batches**. A batch is one agent, or `parallel: [agents]`. Wiring is `reports: previous | all | none | [names]`. Constraints already exist: no nested parallel, no human inside parallel, no forward `reports`, fail at resolve not mid-run.

It is **not** GitHub Actions. It is a list with one optional fan-out per batch.

pr-hero today is one of those recipes, hardcoded in `execute()`: optional scout → parallel hunters → (code: dedupe) → optional refuter → (code: tiers). Scout and summarizer are extra flags, not list entries. There is no `-p`.

---

## Target: Convoy’s shape, pr-hero’s contracts

```text
operator picks one id
        │
        v
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PIPELINE (data, named, coexists)             │
│  steps: scout? → parallel hunters → refuter?  │
│  + optional summarizer                        │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘

└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        │
        v
   findings.json   (always)
```

### Kinded steps (closed enum)

| kind | Output contract | Parallel? | May be omitted? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scout` | `ScoutLead[]`, never a finding | no (one) | yes |
| `hunter` | `HunterDraft` → stamped into drafts | **yes, with other hunters** | **no: ≥1 required** |
| `refuter` | per-finding verdict | no (one, after merge) | yes |
| `summarizer` | `RunSummary`, cosmetic | with hunters, as today | yes |

A new kind (`counsel`, `advisor`, re-review adjudicator) is an **engine change once**: new output type, new validator, one new resolver rule. After that, pipelines just turn the slot on. That is how scout landed. It is not a YAML free-for-all.

Convoy’s `advisor` is **not** a pipeline step. It is a side consult during a writing phase. If we ever want that, it is a per-step flag, not a reason to open the kind enum.

### Engine glue — why findings survive

These cannot appear in a pipeline list, so they cannot be forgotten:

1. **Gotchas** — fail-loud before any step.
2. **Dedupe** — always between hunters and refuter. Drafts do not skip it via `reports:`.
3. **`deriveTier`** — always after refuter (or after hunters if no refuter). Blocking vs advisory stays code.

That is the load-bearing difference from Convoy. Their next step *reads files*. Ours next step *consumes typed output*. Hunters always feed dedupe. Dedupe always feeds refuter-or-tiers. No pipeline author can rewire that.

### Resolver rules (illegal graphs fail before spend)

Same job as Convoy’s `checkPipelineResolves`:

- ≥1 `hunter`. Zero hunters = not a review.
- If `scout` is present, it is before every hunter.
- `parallel` contains only `hunter` kinds.
- At most one `scout`, one `refuter`, one `summarizer`.
- If `refuter` is present, it is after all hunters. The engine inserts dedupe in between; the list cannot name dedupe.
- Unknown kind, unknown hunter key (until C2), dangling prompt file: fail at load.
- No nested parallel. No forward wiring.

A pipeline that wants “scout instead of hunters” does not resolve. Findings stay undefeated.

### Models (per pipeline, per step)

This is already in the engine, unused as a recipe knob. `AgentSpec.model` and the scout/summarizer slots already take a model. Precedence today (`pipeline.ts` `resolveModel`):

```text
CLI --model  >  step/spec model  >  prompt frontmatter
```

Named pipelines make that the interesting layer: **the pipeline pins models**. Two pipelines can share the same hunter files and differ only by who runs on opus, grok, or sonnet.

| Want | How | Blocked? |
|---|---|---|
| Pipeline `hunters-opus`: all hunters opus, refuter sonnet | each hunter `model: "opus"`, refuter `model: "sonnet"` | no |
| Pipeline `hunters-grok`: same spec, grok hunters, sonnet refuter | another registry entry, different `model` fields | no |
| Scout haiku, hunters sonnet, refuter opus | each kind’s `model` field | no |
| **One run**, reliability on sonnet **and** grok (Convoy `models: [a, b]`) | needs two hunter keys (`reliability`, `reliability-b`) | **yes, until C2** |

The last row is Convoy’s dual-model fan-out *inside one pipeline*. Distinct from “this pipeline vs that pipeline use different models.” We want the second now; the first waits on schema v1.1 and a merge-semantics decision (two models on the same prompt are not independent corroboration — `ROADMAP.md` C2).

`--model` remains a **deliberate smear**: it overrides every step. Use it to force a whole run onto one model for a cost test. Do not use it as how recipes declare mix-and-match; that lives on the pipeline.

`pipeline.json` / findings telemetry already have per-agent model via `resolveModel`. Phase 1 must record the pipeline-pinned models so an A/B of `hunters-opus` vs `hunters-grok` is attributable.

### First named pipelines (today’s behaviour, named)

| id | Steps | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `hunters` | parallel local hunters + refuter | CLI default. Scout off |
| `lab` | `defaultReviewSpec()` (no lifecycle) | what `runPipeline` uses if no spec is passed |
| `scout-led` | scout → same hunters + refuter | today’s `--scout` |

Creating a new one, Convoy-style, is adding another list that still passes the resolver — not editing `execute()` for each idea.

---

## Steal / refuse

| Convoy | pr-hero |
|---|---|
| `-p hunter` selector | later `--strategy` / `--pipeline` (name TBD) |
| `pipelines:` in config, shadow built-ins | yes, after the registry exists |
| `parallel: []` | hunters only |
| `reports: previous\|all\|none\|[names]` | **no.** Typed contracts + engine glue |
| Markdown report as step output | JSON contracts we already have |
| LLM consensus (`hunter-report`) | `dedupe.ts` + refuter + `deriveTier` |
| Any agent in any slot | closed kinds |
| Writable fixer pipelines (`ultra-refine`) | out of scope for this engine (read-only review) |
| Frozen run plan, resume from reports on disk | we already freeze artifacts; keep it |

---

## Proposed types (design, not code)

Phase 1 occupancy (does not change `execute()` control flow):

```ts
export interface ReviewPipeline {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  spec: ReviewSpec; // hunters + optional refuter
  scout?: { promptPath: string; model?: string };
  summarizer?: { promptPath: string; model?: string };
  hopBudget?: number;
  agentsDir?: string; // optional default; --agents wins
}
```

Phase 4 kinded list (Convoy-shaped, resolver-enforced). Equivalent occupancy, authorable as steps:

```ts
type ReviewStep =
  | { kind: "scout"; promptPath: string; model?: string }
  | { kind: "hunter"; key: string; file: string; model?: string }
  | { kind: "parallel"; steps: Extract<ReviewStep, { kind: "hunter" }>[] }
  | { kind: "refuter"; file: string; model?: string }
  | { kind: "summarizer"; promptPath: string; model?: string };

type ReviewPipelineV2 = { id: string; label: string; steps: ReviewStep[] };
```

Phase 1 **is** the first three rows of the table above encoded as occupancy. Phase 4 is the same facts written as a list, so a fourth pipeline does not add a fourth `PipelineInput` flag. Both phases keep findings.

(Corrected 2026-08-28: this section and R19 previously numbered the kinded list "Phase 2", contradicting the Phasing table, where Phase 2 is the *selector* and the kinded list is Phase 4 — the only phase that touches `execute()`'s shape. The Phasing table is authoritative because it carries the full sequence; these two references were stale.)

Do not start at V2. A resolver over a kinded list is the piece that can saturate `execute()` if we invent it before the registry even names today’s two modes.

---

## Requirements

### Operator

- **R1.** One launch runs exactly one pipeline.
- **R2.** Creating B does not mutate A.
- **R3.** Default is byte-identical to today’s CLI review.
- **R4.** Selection is one id. Later surface: flag + config. Flag > config > `hunters`.
- **R5.** Unknown id is a hard error. The plan prints the id.

### Findings invariant

- **R16.** Resolve fails unless the pipeline contains ≥1 hunter kind.
- **R17.** Scout output cannot enter `findings[]`. Refuter cannot mint findings. Summarizer cannot mint findings.
- **R18.** Dedupe and `deriveTier` are not expressible as steps and always run.

### Experimentation

- **R6.** Prompt set is independent. Same pipeline + different `--agents` is a legal A/B.
- **R7.** Artifacts record `pipeline.id` (or `strategy.id`) **and** `prompt_set.{name,sha256}`.
- **R8.** `hunters` vs `scout-led` differ only by the scout step (M6’s one variable).
- **R20.** A pipeline may pin `model` on any kinded step. Two pipelines may share prompts and differ only by models. Creating that pair is a registry entry, not an engine change.
- **R21.** Dual-model fan-out of the *same* hunter key in one run is out of scope until C2.

### Creation

- **R9.** Phase 1: add a registry entry. `pipeline.ts` control flow unchanged.
- **R10.** Spec + agents dir still pass `validateReviewSpec` + `agentsDirProblems`.
- **R11.** Scout/summarizer prompts stay engine-owned, outside the prompt-set fingerprint.
- **R19.** Phase 4: a new pipeline is a kinded list that the resolver accepts. Illegal lists never spawn.

### Robustness

- **R12.** Isolation flags, schema v1.0.0, gotchas fail-loud are not pipeline knobs.
- **R13.** Scout biases; it does not replace the hunter scan (`docs/scout-design.md` §3.4).
- **R14.** Precedence as in the table below. `--scout` vs `--pipeline scout-led`: Phase 1 sugar; Phase 2 disagree → fail loud.
- **R15.** `lab` vs `hunters` become named. Callers stop relying on “forgot to pass spec.”

| Knob | Who wins |
|---|---|
| pipeline id | flag > config > `hunters` |
| `--agents` | flag > pipeline.agentsDir > config > env |
| `--model` | one-shot experiment override of **every** step (existing JD rule). A pipeline that pins per-step models is the recipe; `--model` smears them on purpose |
| `--hop-budget` | flag > pipeline.hopBudget > engine default |

---

## Non-goals

- GitHub Actions / arbitrary `needs:` graphs.
- Convoy’s markdown `reports:` bus inside a review.
- Replacing mechanical dedupe with an LLM judge.
- Scout-only or advisor-only “reviews.”
- Writable fixer loops (`ultra-refine`). Different product.
- New hunter keys before C2.
- New kinds (`counsel`) in the first slices — they need a contract first.
- Implementing in this session.

---

## Phasing (so we don’t saturate)

| Phase | Lands | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| **0 — this doc** | Ratification | none |
| **1 — registry** | Name today’s recipes. `--scout` = `scout-led`. Tests: default byte-identical | low; no `execute()` rewrite |
| **2 — selector** | `--pipeline` / `--strategy`, config, `pipeline.json` | low; operator surface |
| **3 — more occupancy** | `light`, measured `deep`, drop-refuter | low; still slots |
| **4 — kinded list** | Convoy step list + resolver. First consumer: the same recipes rewritten as lists, golden-equal to Phase 1 | medium; this is the only phase that touches `execute()` shape |
| **C2 (separate)** | New hunter keys as hunter steps | schema, not pipeline layer |

Phase 1–2 are the Convoy *selector*. Phase 4 is the Convoy *authoring model*, with kinds instead of free agents. Skipping to Phase 4 before 1 is how this saturates the system.

Phase 1 may land during DoorDash if `hunters` / `scout-led` are exactly today’s two behaviours. Phase 4 waits until after M6: it can change spawn shape even when occupancy is equal, and M6 is one-variable.

**How a new pipeline is scored (2026-08-19):** n-vs-n on Martian’s public 50, not musive-only. Protocol,
isolation, cost, and the Cal.com-first slice (10 PRs, Surface A scored): `docs/martian-bench.md`. One
pipeline id per arm (this doc’s unit of choice). Run via `skills/martian-bench/SKILL.md`. Do not start a new arm from this file.

---

## How a new experiment looks

**Against Martian (when authorised):** same 50 public PRs, one pipeline id, their judge + stored
vendor reviews. See `docs/martian-bench.md`. Still one variable.

**Prompt wording:** same pipeline id, new `--agents` folder.

**Scout vs not:** `--pipeline hunters` vs `--pipeline scout-led`. M6.

**No refuter / light:** a new list that the resolver still accepts (hunters remain). Own experiment.

**Models only:** same steps and prompt set, different per-step `model`. Own experiment (one variable: model mix). Do not combine with a prompt-set change in the same A/B.

**A genuinely new job (counsel):** first write its output contract and one resolver rule (engine). Then it is just another kind pipelines may include. Not a YAML escape hatch.

---

## Open Questions (parked — answer when the slice is picked up)

1. **Name.** Convoy uses `pipeline`. This conversation used `strategy`. The flag should match (`-p` vs `--strategy`).
2. **Scout-led = hunters + scout, not scout instead of hunters.** Treated as load-bearing in this doc (aligned with `docs/scout-design.md` §3.4). Re-confirm at implementation time.
3. **`--agents` always wins** over a pipeline default, so prompt-set A/Bs stay one-variable.
4. **Authoring depth on first build.** Recommendation: registry + selector first; kinded step list later. Whole item is post-launch as of 2026-08-18.
5. **Kinded-list cap:** only `scout | hunter | refuter | summarizer`, no `reports:` field, no second hunter wave — unless a later product call chooses the markdown bus (Obstacle 2).

---

## Next Step

Nothing in this document is scheduled. When it comes off the After layer: re-read the Decision Summary and Obstacles, then a separate implementation slice for Phase 1 (registry) with default behaviour byte-identical to today's CLI.

# Addendum — User-authored pipelines and packaged agents

**Added 2026-08-28 (Juanma + session).** Still **DEFERRED**; this addendum records decisions and
gaps so the reasoning is not re-derived. It does not change the freeze: build after the
multi-provider work (Phase D), not before.

The document above answers "can *we* name pipelines." This addendum answers the question it
never asked: **can a user author one, and package agents to reuse across them.** The answer is
yes, and most of the machinery already exists.

## The contract, in one line

> A user may define any review shape, as long as the output fits the schema.

Shape is free. Output is the standard. That is the whole deal, and it is what keeps this an
open-source *reviewer* rather than a generic workflow runner.

## Why the language does not matter, and what does

The authoring file will ship with a skill that teaches its shape (the mechanism already exists —
`src/assets.ts` bundles `pr-hero-triage` and `pr-hero-ci-setup` today), so YAML vs JSON vs
TypeScript is not a pedagogy problem. One thing does decide it:

**Config that is data, never config that is code.** A TypeScript pipeline file is code executing
inside our process. A repository's `.prhero/` can arrive in a pull request from a stranger.
Accepting executable config contradicts rule 4 (`CLAUDE.md`), which treats isolation as a threat
model rather than a preference.

**Decision: YAML under `.prhero/`, parsed and validated by a resolver we own.** Someone who
prefers TypeScript generates the YAML; never the reverse.

The second reason is smaller but real: when we parse, we own the error.

```
.prhero/pipelines.yml: step 3: unknown kind "fixer".
Valid kinds: scout | hunter | refuter | summarizer
```

That is what makes this document's own rule — *illegal graphs fail before spend* — enforceable
rather than aspirational.

**The validator is the product, not the file.** The YAML is the door; the resolver is the lock,
and it is the only thing standing between a stranger's pipeline and the canonical store.

## How agents actually communicate today (they do not)

Recorded because it was not written down anywhere, and because it is the reason declaring
step inputs is unnecessary.

**Agents never talk to each other. There is no bus, no channel, no shared state.** The topology
is a star with the driver at the centre. Every agent receives exactly one thing — a `prompt`
string the driver composes — and returns exactly one thing: text, which the driver parses into a
typed object.

The four builders are the whole surface (`src/pipeline.ts`):

```ts
hunterPrompt(patch, hopBudget, nonce, leadsBlock)   // :1027
summarizerPrompt(patch, nonce)                      // :1092
refuterPrompt(oneJson, nonce)                       // :1503
scoutPrompt(patch, nonce)                           // :1920
```

- **scout → hunter**: the driver validates the scout's output into `ScoutLead[]`, renders a
  `leadsBlock` string, and interpolates it into the hunter's prompt. The hunter never learns a
  scout existed; it saw one more block of text.
- **hunters → refuter**: the driver collects drafts, runs the mechanical `dedupe.ts` (pure code,
  no LLM), and then builds one refuter prompt **per finding** — `refuterPrompt(oneJson, …)`,
  singular. Refuter steps are independent because each starts knowing only its own claim.

Every non-engine block travels wrapped in a nonce-delimited envelope (§3.4, C4) because a
`claim` is hunter prose about possibly attacker-controlled code. **This is what makes accepting
third-party agents safe at all**: another agent's output enters the next prompt as delimited
data, never as instruction.

## What a new kind actually costs

Two functions and one rule:

1. a **prompt builder** — what text the driver composes for it;
2. an **output parser/validator** — what type it returns, checked before anything downstream;
3. one **resolver rule** — where it may sit in the graph.

That is exactly how `scout` landed. "An engine change once" is not bureaucracy; it is these
three pieces. Afterwards every pipeline can turn the slot on from YAML.

## Packaged agents

An agent is already a package and nobody wrote that down: a `.md` file whose frontmatter carries
its **model** and its **tools** (`agent.tools`, `pipeline.ts:1028`) and whose body is the
behaviour. Users already swap whole sets with `--agents`.

To finish the idea, the package needs: a **name** it can be referenced by from several pipelines,
and a **provider** (arriving with D2's `ResolvedModelRoute`, which already separates
`backend` / `provider` / `modelFamily` / `modelSnapshot`).

The split:

| Layer | Declares | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent** (`.md`, shareable) | behaviour (prompt), default model, tools, later provider | user |
| **Pipeline** (`.yml`, the recipe) | which agents, order, what runs in parallel, model/provider overrides | user |
| **Engine** (code, not declarable) | what each kind receives, dedupe, `deriveTier`, schema validation | us |

### One thing to refuse: a step may not declare its inputs

What a step receives is fixed **by its kind**. Letting a pipeline declare inputs is precisely
Convoy's `reports:` bus, and it is how `findings[]` stops being a guarantee: a user could wire
hunter → hunter, skip dedupe, or feed a summarizer into a refuter.

The argument for it is not restriction, it is reuse. **A fixed input contract is what makes an
agent composable** — the same reason a component with a stable props contract drops into any
screen. Because the kind fixes the input, *any* hunter works in *any* pipeline. If agents
declared their own inputs, each would only work in pipelines that happened to supply them.

Tool capability stays capped by rule 4 (no `Write`/`Task`/`Bash`; the driver owns all file
writes). A user can package an agent that **reads** in new ways, never one that writes. Say this
in the authoring skill rather than letting someone discover it.

## Schema generalization (this is what C2 is for)

The engine's own biography is currently mixed into the finding schema. Classified honestly:

| Field | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `id`, `path`, `line`, `symbol`, `claim`, `proof_refs`, `dedupe_key` | universal — keep |
| `severity`, `evidence_class`, `causal_disposition`, `refuter_verdict`, `tier` | **opinionated on purpose — keep closed.** These are the product; they are the difference between a finding and a comment |
| `hunter` | closed enum of four → **open string**, the current four surviving as built-ins |
| `hops_used`, `hop_trail` | assume graph-hop investigation → make **optional**; a user's hunter may do none |
| `category` | **drop, or make optional, or replace with open `tags: string[]`** — see below |

**`category` is the worst-fitted field in the schema and it fails silently.** It is hard-validated
to `1-14` (`findings.ts:251`) against `hunting-map.md`, a taxonomy that **does not exist in this
repository** — it lives in the private lab at `../deep-review/intel/hunting-map.md`. A shipped
open-source tool therefore validates every finding against a document its users cannot read.

Compare the two failure modes, because the difference is the point:

| Field | How it fails a user |
|---|---|
| `hunter: "security"` | **loudly** — validation error; you know you are blocked |
| `category: 7` | **silently** — validates fine, means nothing |

The closed `hunter` enum stops you. `category` waves you through with an invented number.

**The canonical store is permissive already** — `src/store.ts` inserts `hunter` and `category` as
plain columns with no `CHECK` constraints, so an open hunter key needs no migration there. One
fossil to retire: the runs table carries `parity_hunter_fired`, a column named after one specific
hunter, which stops making sense once hunters are user-defined.

## Open gaps — named, not solved

1. **The cost model is calibrated to our recipe.** `estimateCost` (`src/report.ts:75`) takes
   `hunterCount`, `scout`, `summarizer` and `verificationSteps` as terms, but the refuter rides
   inside the coefficients — its own comment says every calibration run included the refuter leg.
   A user pipeline with no refuter, with twelve hunters, or with a new kind gets a wrong band, and
   that band is the pre-run money gate. Needs re-derivation before user pipelines can spend.
2. **Refuter independence is undefined for user pipelines.** §13 requires the refuter to prove
   provider+family independence or record correlated fallback without inflating confidence. A user
   YAML can pin the same model everywhere. Decide: warn, refuse, or record — and if recorded,
   where it surfaces.
3. **Trust in shared agents.** The nonce envelope protects inter-step *data*. An agent's own
   system prompt is trusted **by construction** — it is the instruction. Installing a third-party
   agent hands it the engine's voice. If agents become shareable, this needs a story
   (provenance, review, pinning) that does not exist today.
4. **`parity_hunter_fired`** — a run-table column and a `pipeline.json` key named after one
   hunter. Harmless now, meaningless once hunters are user-defined.

## Prerequisite: shell debt sitting directly in this work's path

Measured 2026-08-28, so the numbers are facts rather than impressions.

**The architecture itself is sound, and the parts that matter for growth are the sound ones.**
All twelve `*-preflight.ts` modules import no I/O whatsoever — the pure/decision split is real,
not aspirational, so every hard decision is testable offline. Dependency direction is correct:
`cli.ts` imports 56 modules and only 5 import it, meaning the shells depend on the core and the
core depends on nothing. The test-to-source ratio is 1.01:1 (50,596 test lines against 49,871
source lines). And D1-08 proved the layering empirically: five modules and ~108 tests landed
without touching `spec.ts` or `findings.ts`.

**The debt is in the shell, and it is concentrated, not diffuse.** `cli.ts` is 6,443 lines, but
it holds 104 functions across 22 verbs — roughly five per command, which is organisation, not a
god object. Three functions carry the problem:

| Function | Approx. lines |
|---|---|
| `reviewPr` | **~1,188** |
| `review` | ~495 |
| `postInlineFindings` | ~390 |

`reviewPr` alone is 2.4% of the entire source tree in one function. Nobody holds that in their
head, and rule 1 of this project — *design before code, grounded in the real code* — is not
satisfiable against it.

**Why this belongs in this document rather than a general cleanup backlog:** `reviewPr` is
exactly where a `--pipeline` / `--strategy` flag lands. The largest function in the project sits
directly on this work's path, so it must be read in full before Phase 2's selector can be added.
That makes it a prerequisite, not a tidiness preference.

Scope it narrowly. This is **not** a call to refactor `cli.ts` wholesale: the layering is already
right and rewriting what works would be the expensive mistake. Split the three functions above —
`reviewPr` first — and leave the rest alone.

One related fossil, cheap to retire while in the area: `parity_hunter_fired` is a runs-table
column and a `pipeline.json` key named after one specific hunter. Harmless today; meaningless the
moment hunters are user-defined.

## Sequencing

**C2 comes first.** It is the real blocker: without opening the `hunter` enum, the most elegant
YAML in the world can still only declare four specialties, and a user's `security` or `react`
hunter fails validation. The registry (Phase 1) and the kinded list (Phase 4) are plumbing by
comparison.

Order, with the prerequisite in place:

| # | Work | Why here |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Split `reviewPr` (and then `review`, `postInlineFindings`) | It is where the selector lands; it must be readable before Phase 2 |
| 1 | **C2** — open the `hunter` enum, decide `category`, make hop fields optional | Without it a user pipeline can only name four specialties |
| 2 | Phase 1 — registry: name today's recipes | Low risk, no `execute()` change |
| 3 | Phase 2 — selector: `--pipeline`, config, `pipeline.json` | Lands in the function step 0 made readable |
| 4 | Phase 3 — more occupancy (`light`, `deep`, drop-refuter) | Still slots |
| 5 | Phase 4 — kinded list + resolver, user-authored YAML | The only phase touching `execute()`'s shape |

Step 0 is deliberately not a `cli.ts` refactor. Three functions, nothing else — the layering
around them is already correct and rewriting it would cost more than it returns.

Nothing here contradicts the freeze at the top of this document. It is written down so that when
the multi-provider work finishes, this starts from a decision, not from a conversation.

// Refuter-discrimination probe fixture (ROADMAP A2 diagnostic, not an arm).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The A2 refuter's first live measurement returned
// `corroborated` on 15 of 15 findings — a 0% false-positive reduction. Two
// explanations fit that data equally well: (a) those hunters were genuinely
// precise, or (b) the v2 refuter prompt is deferential and never refutes
// anything. A replay cannot separate them, because a replay contains no
// finding whose truth value is known in advance — every verdict is graded
// against the same fallible judgement it is supposed to check.
//
// This fixture supplies what the replay cannot: claims whose truth value is
// KNOWN before the model sees them, against code that positively decides them.
// Four arms over the SAME repo, the same agent file, the same model, the same
// finding shape — only the claim, its location and its proof_refs change:
//   - `true-claim`       (control) — accurate claim         → corroborated
//   - `false-claim`      (easy)    — contradicted nearby    → refuted
//   - `hard-false-claim` (depth)   — contradicted 3 files away → refuted
//   - `latent-claim`     (G6)      — real, unreachable code → downgraded-latent
// The control carries as much weight as the tests: without it, an all-`refuted`
// result would read as success when it is really a broken probe.
//
// WHY FOUR ARMS. The first two only decide whether the gate refutes ANYTHING,
// and they measure the easiest case there is. They cannot separate "reads the
// code" from "reads the fourteen lines it was handed": the easy arm's disproof
// sits two lines above the cited signature in the smallest file in the repo.
// The last two arms probe where calibration is actually decided —
//   - `hard-false-claim` keeps the disproof mechanical and citable but moves it
//     three call hops and three files out (`shard.ts` ← `router.ts` ←
//     `settings.ts` ← `normalise.ts`): the value the claim calls unsafe is
//     clamped long before it reaches the cited line, and nothing at that line
//     says so. Only a refuter that WALKS the chain can find the contradiction.
//   - `latent-claim` is the G6 lesson — "real but unreachable today" — which
//     has never been tested once: a real, correctly described defect in a
//     module nothing imports. The only right answer is `downgraded-latent`:
//     keep it, record it, never block a merge on it.
//
// The planted retry function is DELIBERATELY guarded. `withRetry` validates its
// `attempts` argument on the third line, so the easy false claim ("it never
// validates `attempts`") is disproved by a line the refuter can cite — exactly
// the positive disproof Mandate 2 of the A2 prompt demands. The same discipline
// governs the hard arm: `normaliseShardCount` replaces anything below 1, so a
// careful reader following the chain lands on one citable contradicting line.
// Neither false arm is unfalsifiable; an ambiguous arm would return
// `inconclusive` for reasons that have nothing to do with the hypothesis.
//
// REACHABILITY IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CONTROL, and it points in OPPOSITE directions
// per arm. The retry and shard targets must be LIVE — `downgraded-latent` would
// otherwise be a legitimate third answer on those arms and would confound the
// verdict — while the cache target must be an ORPHAN, because that verdict IS
// the hypothesis there. So the head tree is checked, not trusted:
// assertHeadWiring() fails the build if a live edge disappears or if anything
// ever imports the orphan module.

// PR #315 review F001: the harness appends bookkeeping lines to a step's
// stderrTail after the transport's own tail, and the progress reason
// (pipeline.ts stepFailureReason) must be able to skip them. This file pins
// the predicate that recognizes them, owned in harness.ts next to the
// appends. The texts are literal copies on purpose — the end-to-end proof
// that the harness's REAL appends match lives in credential-projection.test.ts.

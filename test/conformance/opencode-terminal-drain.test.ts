// Issue #132: the poll observer can win §197's terminal slot while the stream
// is still delivering the turn's answer text, and the attempt then reports
// success over a TRUNCATED finalText — a well-formed terminal proof, a
// `completion: "ok"`, and a short answer the harness goes on to judge as a
// format violation or parse as a genuinely empty finding set. Worse than a
// hang, which is loud and ends at the watchdog.
//
// What was already true, and what the issue does not say: the slot win does
// NOT settle at once. It arms a post-win window (`cleanupMs`) whose original
// purpose is §197's — a later conflicting terminal must still be able to flip
// the outcome malformed — and the stream keeps draining inside it. The defect
// is that the window is a FIXED TIMER, not a drain check: it never asks
// whether the stream is still delivering, so it is a bet rather than a
// guarantee, and when it loses nothing says so.
//
// The fix keeps the two observers independent where §197 requires it. Asking
// "is the stream still delivering?" is a DELIVERY question, not an EVIDENCE
// one — what may never be armed from the stream is the poll's boundary
// detection (`observedActive`, opencode-client.ts), and that is untouched.
// The window now re-arms while deltas keep arriving, and when the drain budget
// runs out with content STILL arriving the attempt says so: integrity
// `truncated`, a declared marker, and `protocol_truncation` — an OBSERVED
// signal, never the parse-failure heuristic #124 exists to end.
//
// Scope is `provider_terminal` only, by decision: it is the one settle reason
// that reports success, so the one where a truncated answer is silent. The
// abort and failure reasons already return `failed`/`cancelled` carrying their
// own diagnosis, and `abort_confirmed` cannot afford a drain window at all
// (§5.2 line 272 — it would overrun the 6,500 ms harness deadline).

// Two failures in one. The allowlist allowed nothing — the #116 smoke's

// relevant consumers") about tool use they never performed. And the denylist
// denied nothing beyond bash, leaving write/edit/apply_patch/task/webfetch/

// D-11: the poll observer's own readback (opencode-client.ts pollStatus,

// (true) — unlike the #223 prompt_result call site above, which was fixed to
// `{ emit: false }` for exactly the same reason. The poll site discards
// `reconciled.events` the same way the prompt_result call site used to
// (opencode-sdk.ts's poll branch reads only `failure`/`terminalProof`/
// `finalText`/`usage`/`usageIncomplete`), so the same hazard applies: if the
// stream has already delivered a PREFIX of a text part when the poll's HTTP
// readback observes the part's already-persisted FULL text, the poll's
// reconcile advances `emittedText` to the full text for a consumer that was
// only ever handed the prefix. The stream's own still-in-flight remaining
// deltas for that part then find `emittedText` already past what was really
// delivered: `handlePartDelta`'s then text-suffix dedup check
// (`emittedText.endsWith(delta)`, since replaced by event-id dedupe — D-13)
// does not recognise them as already-covered, so they are appended AGAIN as
// duplicate delta events (corrupting delivery), and the part's own later
// snapshot/session.idle boundary event finds `snapshotText` shorter than the
// now-inflated `emittedText` and throws "conflicting snapshot observed" —
// exactly the failure #223 fixed at the other call site, reopened at this one.
//
// These tests drive `reconcileMessages` (the exact call the poll site makes)
// and `mapOpenCodeEvents` (the exact call the stream pump makes) directly, in
// the ordering a live race would produce, so it is exact and never a timing

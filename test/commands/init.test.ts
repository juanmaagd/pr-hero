// `init` is not exported as a testable-in-isolation shell in the usual
// sense — it reads the real `os.homedir()`, so driving it end-to-end would
// make this suite depend on the machine's `~/.prhero/config.json`). Its
// DECISION lives in `initGotchasInstructions` and is tested exhaustively in
// test/review/preflight.test.ts; what is left to guard here is the wiring —
// that `init` routes through that helper instead of printing the block
// again itself. Source-shape, like the count assertions in
// test/cli.test.ts's "every gotchas gate asks the shared predicate", and for
// the same reason. Moved here from test/cli.test.ts (cli-decomp S3) when
// `init` moved to src/commands/init.ts — the source-text needle now lives at
// its new home.

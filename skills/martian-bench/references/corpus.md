# Eval corpus — triangulate, do not replace

Martian is the n-vs-n field. It is not the only number. Read this **before** spend and **when** answering “how did we do”.

If Martian and musive disagree: musive + human triage wins for **product**. Martian wins for **where we sit vs CodeRabbit**. Write both. Do not average.

## 1. Martian Cal.com 10 — baseline arm `hunters` (2026-08-19)

On disk. **$0 to re-read.** Do not overwrite these dirs for a new arm.

| Artifact | Path |
|---|---|
| Ledger / how to read the number | `docs/benchmarks/martian-bench.md` § Cal.com 10 results |
| Judge JSON | `~/Desktop/martian-cal/runs/martian-judge.json` |
| Per-PR runs | `~/Desktop/martian-cal/runs/cal-<pr>-hunters/` |
| Adapter tests | `test/martian-adapter.test.ts` (offline) |

Pipeline: hunters (reliability/resilience/lifecycle + refuter), scout off, summarizer off, parity off, prompt set `slice3b-lifecycle-v6-clean` (`sha256: 5ac28df9bddbd4c8`). Judge: Martian prompt, Claude Code CLI `sonnet`, `tools:[]`. Unreplicated. Cal.com only.

**Headline (not All F1):** High+Critical recall **13/19 = 0.68**. High 12/17. Low 0/9. All-profile P 0.44 / R 0.41 / F1 0.43 (tp 17 fp 22 fn 24 / 41). Strict gold-side recall 17/35 = 0.49.

| Category | Recall |
|---|---|
| concurrency | 3/4 |
| data | 2/3 |
| security | 1/1 |
| bug | 10/23 |
| api | 1/4 |
| style / perf / docs / speculative | 0 |

**Best cells:** 11059 6/9 (OAuth/credential-sync), 7232 2/3 (reminder `forEach` + `immediateDelete`). **Zeros:** 8330 (dayjs `===`, slot arithmetic — second golden found then merged away), 22345 (empty review, Insights/`Prisma.sql`). **Weak TP:** 22532 0.65 same-site, opposite claim on `@updatedAt`. **Reliability miss:** 14740 Critical `isTeamAdmin && isTeamOwner` (should be OR).

Profile: concurrency / lifecycle / OAuth plumbing **yes**. Small local logic **no**.

Cost: reviews $42.43 + judge $0.89 = **$43.32**.

A new arm is a delta against **this** table, not against vibes.

## 2. Musive Greptile H2H — product instrument

`src/compare.ts` + `src/compare-report.ts` + `src/ledger.ts`. Location-only (path + line ±25), not claim text. Live on **our** repo. Cannot see C10’s both-missed cell. **Unchanged by Martian.** Do not retire it. Do not quote Martian F1 as if it replaced this.

## 3. M6 scout A/B — DoorDash track

`scripts/m6.ts`, `docs/benchmarks/m6-floor-cases.json`, `src/floor-test.ts`. Frozen musive control set. Scout on vs off. Paused 2026-08-19 for calibration. **Different corpus, different question.** Do not mix a Martian weekend with an M6 variable. Scout-led on Cal.com is a **new Martian arm** (one variable: scout), not an M6 substitute.

Pilot learning (n=12 musive): scout concentrated instead of widening; prompt-set sha was identical across arms. See Engram / M6 notes before assuming scout helps Martian recall.

## 4. Fixture eval — cheap gate before Martian money

`bun run fixture-eval` (~$0.08, ~1 min). Planted bug in a disposable repo. A methodology that cannot catch the planted bug does not deserve a Cal.com re-run. Optional `--scout`.

## 5. Refuter-probe — first gate for refuter prompt edits

`bun run refuter-probe`. Four known-correct verdicts: `corroborated`, `refuted` (adjacent and 3-hop), `downgraded-latent`. A prompt edit that cannot pass it does not deserve a $10 Martian replay (ROADMAP A2).

## 6. Live micro-eval

`bun run scripts/live-micro-eval.ts` (~$0.04). One trivial real spawn. Use to verify isolation flags / runner shape, not quality.

## 7. Lab goldens — sealed

`../deep-review/dataset/test.jsonl` — **never read**. THE PIVOT retired them as the thing we optimise. Prompt sets under `../deep-review/agents/<set>/` are **immutable once scored**. Martian does not reopen Phase A.

Lab ledger: `../deep-review/bench/METRICS.md` (append-only). Different instrument.

## 8. Vendor rows we do not yet own

Martian publishes `offline/results/<model>/evaluations.json` (Opus 4.5 / Sonnet 4.5 / GPT-5.2) and `offline/results/benchmark_data.json` (~22 MB stored reviews).

We have **not** injected `pr-hero` into that file and have **not** run their gateway. Pilot human read (3 PRs, their Opus 4.5 evals): Greptile matched us on 14943/8087 (1/2); Greptile+CodeRabbit **2/2 on 8330** (we 0/2). Do not generalise that slice to the ten.

Surface B = bucket our `martian-review.json` against those stored comments. Status: **not run**.

## Comparison recipe (new arm)

1. Re-read §1 numbers. Copy the High+Critical 13/19 as the control.
2. Run the new arm into **new** dirs. Same 10 PRs, same judge script, same judge model.
3. Table: per-PR tp/fp/fn new vs `hunters`. Attribute misses: hunter / merge / refuter / judge.
4. Consult §2–§5. If fixture-eval or refuter-probe regressed, stop — do not publish a Martian win.
5. Ledger both All and High+Critical. Say Surface B ran or not.

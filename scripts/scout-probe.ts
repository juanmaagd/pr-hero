// Scout-prompt probe (ROADMAP-DOORDASH M4 gate — `docs/scout-design.md` §3.10).
//
// This probe decides whether `prompts/scout.md` deserves M6's ~$224. Same
// discipline as refuter-probe: the prompt earns its A/B offline, on real diffs
// from the frozen M0 control set, before anything expensive runs.
//
// WHAT A RESULT MEANS — the two assertions answer DIFFERENT questions, and
// conflating them is the mistake this header exists to prevent.
//
//   COVERAGE (assertion 1) — "can a diff-only pass, with no repository access
//   at all, point at a defect a production reviewer caught and pr-hero missed?"
//   The five targets are the adjudicated `greptile_only` true-positive misses
//   (§2.3), so a hit is not "the scout said something plausible", it is "the
//   scout pointed at a place where a real defect provably was".
//     all five hit ≥2/3  → diff-only is a viable pre-hunter stage; M5 wiring
//                          and M6's A/B are worth paying for.
//     a case hit 0/3     → that case is either not diff-visible or the prompt
//                          is blind to its file type. §3.10's exclusion rule
//                          governs: at most ONE case may be reclassified, and
//                          only after two prompt iterations, with the reason
//                          written into the design doc. Two markdown-runbook
//                          cases are on the list precisely so a prompt that
//                          implicitly assumes TypeScript fails loudly here
//                          rather than quietly in M6.
//     hits on RAW but not CAPPED → not a coverage failure. It is the ceiling
//                          eating a good lead, which is a cap/prompt
//                          interaction M4 must see; both numbers are printed
//                          side by side so it cannot be misattributed.
//
//   RESTRAINT (assertion 2) — "is the scout SELECTIVE?" NOT "is it precise on
//   clean PRs". The six restraint PRs carry untriaged `prhero_only` rows, so
//   "this PR is clean" is not a claim this project owns and a precision number
//   against it would be fiction. What DashBench actually names as the failure
//   mode is filtering nothing — being loud everywhere — and `lead_coverage`
//   (fraction of changed hunks carrying ≥1 lead) measures that without knowing
//   a single defect count. It is a proxy, stated as one.
//   AMENDED 2026-08-18 (§3.10bis): `lead_coverage` is still computed and
//   printed, but it NO LONGER GATES. Its denominator is hunk COUNT, which
//   measures how git split the patch rather than how much changed, and it
//   ordered the six restraint PRs close to backwards — see the constant below
//   for the numbers. The gate is now the absolute one, ratified in the same
//   sentence of §3.10: mean leads per PR ≤ 6.
//     gate passes        → the scout narrows attention rather than restating
//                          the diff.
//     leads per PR high  → leading on every hunk is the same as leading on
//                          nothing; the lever is the prompt's cap discipline,
//                          not the driver's caps (§3.8: a truncation that fires
//                          routinely is a PROMPT defect, never a cap to raise).
//
// LIVE: spends real money (charter rule 6 — the result lands in a ledger). One
// diff-only sonnet step per (PR × replicate), no tools, one attempt. The
// default full run is 10 PRs × 3 replicates = 30 spawns.

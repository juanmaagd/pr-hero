// The guard for a whole class of defect the offline suite structurally cannot
// see: anything that behaves differently inside a Bun-compiled binary.
//
// `bun test` always runs from source, so `import.meta.dir` always names a real
// directory and `detectAssetMode()` always answers "dev". Every code path that
// keys off the compiled runtime is therefore unreachable from the suite. That
// is not a coverage gap to backfill with more unit tests — it is a different
// runtime, and the only honest way to test it is to build the artifact and run
// it. Release v1.0.0 shipped a binary whose `review` command failed for 100% of
// users, past 2466 green tests and a green `doctor`, because nothing here
// executed the thing that was published.
//
// What it proves, concretely: the binary boots, resolves its BUNDLED prompt set
// (which lives at hashed paths inside Bun's virtual filesystem, not in any
// directory), reads those prompts, fingerprints them, and prints a plan — with
// no `/$bunfs` path escaping into user-facing output.
//
// Deliberately free: `--dry-run` spawns no step, so this needs no
// authentication, no network and no money. It costs a compile and about a
// second. It does need a binary NAMED `claude` on PATH, because route
// admission discovers one before the dry run returns — a stub is created below
// and never executed.

// `require("which")` Bun's --compile runtime does not resolve for a package
// living outside the binary — a real defect this file did not
// catch before it shipped (route admission reported "not installed" for an
// SDK that plainly was).
//
// Still free, on purpose: `review --dry-run` reaches the SDK load during

// prepareProductionAdmissionContext (src/production-runtime.ts) — BEFORE the
// dry-run's own early exit, so this needs no auth, no OpenCode credentials

// `opencode` executable (mirroring the `claude` stub): route admission
// observes the binary's `--version` before it ever imports the SDK, and
// never executes it past that, so the stub never has to behave like a real
// server.
//
// Provider "openai" (OPENCODE_OAUTH_PROVIDER, src/security/credential-broker.ts)
// is deliberate, not incidental: it resolves an OAuth credential kind, which
// keeps prepareProductionAdmissionContext OFF the free-model-probe branch

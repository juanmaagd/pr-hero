// M6's harness (ROADMAP-DOORDASH M6, `docs/scout-design.md` §3.11): the floor
// test, both arms, over the 13 canonical cases plus the clean pair.
//
// Three modes, and the first two are deliberately separate commands:
//
//   bun run scripts/m6.ts plan   [--clean 1720,1721]   # $0 — the go/no-go
//   bun run scripts/m6.ts check                        # $0 — the argv, dry-run
//   bun run scripts/m6.ts run    [--clean ...] [--replicates 2] [--only 1717]
//   bun run scripts/m6.ts score  [--runs <root>]        # $0 — read artifacts
//
// RUN `check` BEFORE `run`, every time. It is the same loop with --dry-run
// appended, so it spends nothing, touches nothing, and prints the exact run
// dir each review would resolve. It exists because the first live pilot died
// five minutes in on a defect `check` would have shown for free: `--out` in PR
// mode is the EXACT run dir, not a runs root, so a harness passing one root
// for every review had all twelve runs overwriting each other in place.
//
// `plan` spends nothing and exists because "~$224" was folklore: it prices
// every PR from GitHub's own counters through the SAME `estimateCost` the CLI
// prints before a confirm, and it names the PRs the size gate would refuse
// before a session discovers them one at a time, four minutes apart.
//
// `run` is the only paid one. It spawns the REAL CLI per review — not
// runPipeline directly — because M6 must measure the pipeline an operator
// gets, including its preflight, its exclusions and its gate. Arms are
// INTERLEAVED per PR (control, scout, control, scout) rather than run as two
// blocks: models drift over a four-hour session, and two blocks would confound
// that drift with the arm.
//
// It never passes --post. These are merged PRs on a real repository, and a
// harness that could comment on them is a harness one flag away from doing it.

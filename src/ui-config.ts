// `pr-hero config`'s output, as LINES. Fourth member of the terminal
// surface's pure half (ui.ts formats, ui-select.ts asks, ui-result.ts
// reports, this one explains): same contract as all three — everything is a
// total function of its inputs, the style flag and the width arrive as
// PARAMETERS, and the I/O shell in cli.ts owns the printing and the exit code.
//
// WHY the command exists at all (C5 D10): two layers that cannot be inspected
// are worse DX than one layer that can. The first question a teammate asks is
// "why is this value what it is", and before this the answer was "read two
// files and know the rules". The data was already there — D7 makes
// pipeline.json carry the same per-key source record — so this is a renderer,
// not a mechanism.
//
// WHY it lists DEFAULTS too, unlike the plan card: the card tags only the
// surprising values (global, capped) because it sits between the operator and
// a spend decision and is already dense; cli.ts's configTag says so and names
// this file as where the exhaustive list belongs (judgment ledger JD-21).
// Here the exhaustive list IS the product — a key missing from the listing
// would read as "pr-hero has no such setting".

// width and a painted row wraps EARLIER than the same row unpainted; then
// wrapText splits on whitespace, which can leave a colour's opening escape on
// one line and its reset on the next — and that colour bleeds into whatever
// the terminal prints after the block. This module shipped with exactly that
// bug: `paintSource(...) + value + yellow(marker)` handed straight to row().
//
// WHY not the established fix — cli.ts's markerRowLines builds the row
// unstyled and paints the whole LINE afterwards (`row(..., { styles: false })
// .map(line => paint(line))`) — a config row has TWO spans coloured
// differently, the layer tag and the cap marker, with an uncoloured value
// between them, and one whole-line painter cannot express that. So the same
// discipline is applied one level down: row() lays out the plain
// concatenation, and the colours go back onto the chunks it hands back.
//
// WHY not fold the layer tag into row()'s label column instead, which would
// dodge the wrap entirely: it moves the layout. A long `agents_dir` already
// wraps at 80 columns today (its value lands on the continuation line), and
// widening the label column would pull it back up onto the first line.

// #141: the MCP half of the OpenCode transport. PURE — the impure halves are
// the launcher (which carries the config into the child's environment) and the
// client (which reads the file and verifies the readback).
//
// pr-hero writes ONE mcp registry per run, in Claude Code's shape
// (src/cli.ts's CODEGRAPH_ONLY_MCP_CONFIG), and `binding-policy.ts` gates that
// exact file: not a symlink, `mcpServers` empty or exactly ["codegraph"], and
// an optional sha256 pin. This module TRANSLATES that file rather than letting
// the OpenCode route write its own. A second config would be a registry the
// integrity gate never sees — which is the same thing as no gate at all, since
// the agent cannot tell which registry granted it a tool.
//
// The two shapes are not compatible and never were:
//
//   Claude   { "mcpServers": { codegraph: { type: "stdio",
//                                           command: "codegraph",
//                                           args: ["serve", "--mcp"] } } }
//   OpenCode { "mcp":        { codegraph: { type: "local",
//                                           command: ["<abs>", "serve", …] } } }
//
// (McpLocalConfig, @opencode-ai/sdk types.gen.d.ts:946-969.)

// What `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` carries under `mcp`. Narrow on purpose: the
// SDK's own `McpLocalConfig` also admits `environment` and `timeout`, and this
// transport delivers neither — an environment map here would be a second,
// ungated channel into a child that already inherits the projected one.

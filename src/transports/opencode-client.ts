// Filtering on `field === "text"` — the FIELD NAME — is not that correlation

// provider-generated id would otherwise grow for as long as the session does.
// Eviction is oldest-first (a Map iterates in insertion order), which is the
// safe direction — parts are announced and streamed in order, so the oldest

  // carries that verdict with no adversarial refutation behind it. This used
  // to ship at blocking tier — the dominant case, not a corner: the
  // AudioTrimmer data in the batch comment above put 26 of 26 blocking
  // findings in the deterministic class, which `deriveTier` blocked on unless
  // the refuter POSITIVELY returned `downgraded-latent`.
  //
  // The open product question — whether a truncated run may report blocking
  // tier at all — is CLOSED as of 2026-08-27, and in two halves.
  //
  // Half one, mechanical: it may not, WHEN a refuter was configured and
  // therefore a check really was lost. `finish()` conjoins exactly that
  // (`ceilingFired && refuterConfigured`) and hands it to `deriveTier`
  // (src/findings.ts) as `refuterCutShort`, which demotes only the cut-short +
  // `not_submitted` pair, so skipping THIS leg can no longer dress an
  // unchecked finding in the report's loudest register. A verdict that DID
  // arrive before the ceiling still counts for what it says, and a spec that
  // never configured a refuter is untouched by any of it — the ceiling firing
  // on its hunters cut nothing short.
  //
  // Half two, the judgement call that was left hanging: a `deterministic`
  // finding on a truncated run KEEPS blocking tier. It is locally provable, so
  // it is true whether or not the clock ran out; the report already states the
  // run was partial; and suppressing real signal because of a timer would cost
  // more than the badge is worth. The decision rests on blocking tier gating
  // no merge — the question read as far weightier while the surrounding
  // comments wrongly claimed it stopped one, which is the whole reason it sat
  // open. Revisit this only if that ever stops being true.
  //
  // Still true, and still not closed by any of it: the run is marked `partial`
  // so a consumer can see it was truncated, and the artifact records only the
  // fallback verdict, never WHY the check is missing. Distinguishing "no
  // refuter configured" from "the refuter never got to run" in the artifact
  // needs a new `refuter_verdict` value — a coordinated schema v1.1 bump with
  // the sibling lab (ROADMAP C2), not this gate's to make.

// `pr-hero post --pr <n> --from <run-dir> [--dry-run]` (ROADMAP B6, spec
// "Offline replay via `post` verb"): the `ledger` verb's precedent — read a
// prior run's artifacts off disk — applied to publishing instead of
// aggregating. Exists because PR-mode `--dry-run` returns at reviewPr's own
// step 3, BEFORE any findings exist (see the comment there): it is
// structurally impossible for `--pr --dry-run` to preview a comment plan, so
// this verb is the only way to preview one at $0.
//
// `postCommand` itself stays unexported and untestable on purpose — it is
// nothing but `resolveRepoRoot` (a real `git rev-parse`) plus flag
// narrowing. Everything that can actually go wrong (dry-run vs live, the
// run-status guard, `assertRunMatchesPr`, the receipt) lives in
// `runPostCommand`, exported and `spawnFn`-injectable on EVERY gh-touching
// path including dry-run (CRIT-B, verify-report-pr3 #3305: an unexported
// verb whose dry-run branch never threaded spawnFn could not be proven not
// to reach a real `gh` — this is the $0 gate standing in front of the first
// live GitHub write this project will ever make, and it must not be

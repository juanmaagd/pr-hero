// The boundary-tag rule (C4, `docs/c4-preamble-design.md` §3.3-§3.4): every
// block of a prompt that this engine did not author is wrapped in a named tag
// carrying a per-run nonce, so text inside it cannot end its own block and
// speak as the engine.
//
// This module is driver source: it is covered by the engine version, NOT by
// the prompt-set fingerprint. A prompt-set edit can neither add a tag nor
// remove one.
//
// WHY a nonce instead of Cloudflare's strip (`docs/cloudflare-ai-code-review.md`
// :186-193). Cloudflare deletes boundary-tag names from user content because a
// FIXED tag vocabulary can be forged from inside that content. Their inputs are
// MR bodies and comments, where deleting a stray `</mr_body>` costs nothing.
// Our first and largest block is a diff: stripping `</patch>`-shaped strings
// out of it corrupts the code under review — a legitimate PR can add exactly
// those literals, and a reviewer reading mutated source produces findings about
// code that does not exist. That is a worse failure than the one being
// prevented. A nonce closes the same hole without touching a byte, because the
// tag name cannot be forged by content that was fixed before the nonce existed.

// Closed vocabulary. Item 7 widens it here, not at a call site, so a new
// untrusted block cannot be wrapped under an invented tag name.

// (`scout.ts`'s note on M6), and an empty priors list must likewise leave no
// trace in a system prompt. A `<scout_leads nonce></scout_leads nonce>` pair
// would break both.
//
// Throwing on a forged nonce is the last line of defence, not the first: every
// block whose content can arrive after the nonce was committed is guarded by
// the driver before it reaches here (see `runScout` and `runRefuter`), because
// a throw at prompt-composition time would kill a paid run. A throw that does
// escape means a block reached composition unguarded — which is a defect to
// see, not one to paper over by shipping a forgeable boundary.

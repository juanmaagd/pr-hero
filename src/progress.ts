// The live progress panel's pure half: panel state, its transitions under
// the pipeline's event stream, and frame-text assembly. Everything here is
// testable offline; cli.ts owns the I/O half — TTY detection, the tick, and
// the ANSI cursor positioning that redraws the frame in place.
//
// Deliberately NO percentage bar anywhere: step durations are unknowable up
// front, and a fake number invites exactly the Ctrl-C this slice exists to
// cure. The honest signals are a spinner, elapsed time, and per-step
// completions.
//
// The panel is a TREE (ui-tree.ts), not a list of lines, for one reason: the
// refuter runs ONE STEP PER FINDING and those verdicts used to be a counter
// that overwrote itself (`judging F001 (1 of 2)…`), so a run's most expensive
// leg reported a number instead of its results. As leaves they ACCUMULATE and
// can be watched landing. The second level is deliberately not models:
// spec.agents assigns exactly one model per agent, so a model level would
// give every node exactly one child — a list with extra glyphs.

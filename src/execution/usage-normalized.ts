// 2026-09-02, #177. THE one place that says "this environment carries a
// per-token credential". Two callers need it and they must not each carry
// their own copy: `deriveCiBillingMode` (ci/gates.ts) turns it into a CI spend
// ceiling, and the Claude CLI transport turns it into the `billingMode`
// STAMPED ON EVERY USAGE RECORD it emits. This is the same anti-drift shape
// `credentialKindBillsMetered` (runner-authority.ts) already applies to the
// credential KIND, and for the same measured reason: #177 IS the drift. The CI
// gate already called an API-key route metered while the transport filed that
// user's real spend as `notionalCostUsd`, which renders as "at list price, not
// charged" — and since budget enforcement is cash-only (§8), that user's spend
// ceiling read $0 and stopped existing.
//
// A boolean, not a mode, matching its sibling: the two callers narrow it into
// two DIFFERENT enums (`CiBillingMode`, `UsageBillingMode`), and returning a
// mode here would invite one of them to overwrite the other's semantics
// instead of asking the question this answers.
//
// WHICH variables, and why these two: `ENV_PASSTHROUGH` (harness.ts) projects
// ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN into the child side by side as
// one credential class — a per-token key and a per-token bearer token.
// CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN is deliberately absent: that IS the subscription.
// 2026-09-02: "projects into the child" holds only where no credential
// projection is active. When one IS, `buildChildEnv` strips both keys
// (PROJECTION_OWNED_KEYS, harness.ts) because the projection owns the
// credential, so this predicate reads subscription on that path — which is
// the truth there, and was not before the strip.
// When an OAuth token and a key are both present this repo does not know which
// one the Claude CLI bills (ci/gates.ts states that gap at length), and does
// not need to — presence of a key answers metered, because guessing
// subscription wrongly reports real money as not charged.
//
// Trimming is load-bearing, and it is worth being exact about WHAT it buys,
// because the sentence it replaces overstated it and #177 is a finding about
// comments claiming more than their code. action.yml:111 binds
// ANTHROPIC_API_KEY UNCONDITIONALLY and GitHub renders an unset input as the
// empty string, so every subscription-route CI run carries
// `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""` — but `""` is already falsy, so that case is safe
// with or without the trim. What the trim actually catches is a
// WHITESPACE-ONLY value (a secret whose content is a space, a YAML block
// scalar that kept its newline), which is truthy and would otherwise read as
// a live key and impose a ceiling — or, here, book a subscription run's quota
// spend as cash. Mutation-checked: dropping the trim flips exactly the
// whitespace arms, never the empty-string ones.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ADMISSION WIRING, #161. This predicate now has a SECOND caller:
// `credentialKindForRoute` (runner-authority.ts) — the single place that
// decides which credential a claude-code route runs on, and therefore its
// projection, its broker, and its rate-limit bucket. Until #161 this block
// banned exactly that wiring outright; read both halves below before adding
// a THIRD caller, because the ban is lifted for exactly one function, not
// for the question in general.
//
// Until #197 the reason was safety: deriving either side from env turned a
// metered claude-code route into `pricingApplicability: "required"` with no
// pricing source to answer, so the route was refused admission outright
// (`pricing_table_missing`, blocking) and API-key users stopped being able to
// run at all. #197 flipped the claude-code transport's `pricingReady` to
// `true`, so that refusal can no longer happen and the fail-closed argument
// is spent.
//
// What remained was ownership, and #161 settles it by NAMING the owner
// instead of banning the wiring outright: `credentialKindForRoute` is the
// one admission-side reader of this predicate, and `envBillsMetered` is the
// one shared implementation both it and the Claude CLI transport's
// `claudeCliCostBasis` call — never two copies of the same trim rule
// answering "does this environment carry a per-token credential?"
// differently for the same attempt.
//
// The two calls read DIFFERENT env values on purpose, and on a SUCCESSFUL
// projection that is not a fork: `claudeCliCostBasis` reads the child's
// ACTUAL, POST-projection-strip env (`request.isolation.env`) — a successful
// projection strips the key-bearing vars (`PROJECTION_OWNED_KEYS`,
// harness.ts), so this is a truthful read of what the process the money was
// spent by actually saw. `credentialKindForRoute` runs BEFORE any child
// exists, so it cannot read that env — it reads the raw, pre-strip one plus
// whether a broker WILL ATTEMPT to strip it (`hasBroker`), and
// `!hasBroker && envBillsMetered(rawEnv)` equals `envBillsMetered(postStripEnv)`
// on that path: a successful strip removes the key whenever a broker is
// attached, and the post-strip env equals the raw env exactly when none is.
// Same predicate, same answer, two different envs because one runs before
// the strip and one runs after it.
//
// KNOWN EXCEPTION — #279, not fixed here. A broker's projection can DEGRADE
// (`missing_subscription_record`, credential-broker.ts + harness.ts
// ~756-778) instead of stripping anything: the child then runs UNSTRIPPED,
// so `hasBroker: true` no longer implies "the child's env has no key" —
// admission still says subscription, the spend is not fenced, and
// `claudeCliCostBasis` (reading the real, unstripped child env) correctly
// files it metered. Pre-existing: this exact mismatch already existed for
// every degraded projection before #161, which named the ownership rule but
// did not add or remove this exception.
//
// Everything downstream of the KIND (the projection, the bucket, and
// `FrozenRuntimeBinding.capabilities()`'s `effectiveBillingMode` via
// `credentialKindBillsMetered`) inherits the answer from that one call and
// never re-reads env itself — so admission and usage filing agree by
// construction on a successful projection, #279 aside.
//
// The ban stands for everyone ELSE. `CLAUDE_CAPABILITY_STATICS.billingMode`
// (model/provider-capabilities.ts) stays a static "subscription" on purpose —
// it is the BACKEND-WIDE report, produced before any route (and therefore any
// credential) resolves, so it has no per-route env to read honestly; the
// per-route truth lives on the exact binding instead. A THIRD caller
// deriving straight from env, instead of going through
// `credentialKindForRoute`, is exactly the fork this predicate exists to
// prevent — route it through the kind instead.

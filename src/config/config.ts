// C5 O-6's half of the pipeline input. Unconditional, unlike its two

// while a config ALWAYS resolved to something — and D7's whole point is that
// the artifact must discriminate the builds. `global_present` is carried
// separately because `sources` cannot express it: a global file that exists
// and says `{}` leaves every source at `repo` or `default`, exactly like no
// file at all.
// #173 (§8: "Artifacts and reports show cash and notional totals

// `review()` and `reviewPr()` are I/O shells nothing can call offline, so a
// decision left inline in them is a decision no test can reach. That matters
// more here than usual — `notionalCostUsd` spent three slices fully built and
// entirely unpopulated, and the step that goes missing in that pattern is
// always the last wiring one. Deleting the four call sites below must fail a
// test; without this function it flipped nothing.
//
// Absence, never zero: a run whose steps reported no normalized usage, or
// reported usage carrying no provider figure, yields NO key at all, and both
// renderers omit their notional line on `undefined`. A `0` default would print
// "$0.00 at list price" for a run that never produced a list price — the same
// fabrication `normalizeUnavailableUsage` exists to refuse, relocated to the

//
// `root` is the OPERATOR root in both modes and NEVER the review worktree
// (O-8): a reviewed PR's tree must not influence engine config, and the
// global file is read from os.homedir(), which is one step further from a PR
// author's reach than the operator checkout already was. C5 cannot weaken
// that boundary; it only adds a source the author has strictly less access to.
//
// WHY a missing file yields an ABSENT layer instead of EMPTY_LOCAL_CONFIG:
// the constant materialises `parity_trigger_paths: []` and
// `suspicion_priors: []`, so handing it to the merge would make "no file at
// all" indistinguishable from "a file that said []", and provenance would
// report `repo` for a layer that does not exist. mergeConfig decides what an
// all-silent run resolves to; EMPTY_LOCAL_CONFIG is now the shape that comes
// OUT of that, not the input that goes in.
//
// `--config` overrides the repo path only. A flag that repointed the global
// layer is a footgun with no use case. Its missing-file CliError is
// unchanged: an explicitly named file that is not there stays an error,
// because silently falling back to "no parity triggers" would disable a
// hunter the caller just asked for, and a hunter that never fires looks
// exactly like a hunter that found nothing.
// The global layer on its own, and the ONE place `~/.prhero/config.json` is
// opened. Two callers need it for different reasons and must not read it two
// ways: loadEffectiveConfig folds it under the repo file, while `pr-hero init`
// needs it WITHOUT the repo file, because init is writing that file and asking
// what the global already supplies is the whole of O-9. A second read site
// would be a second chance for the two to disagree about what "the global
// layer" is — the same reason §3.4 collapsed review()/reviewPr()'s duplicated
// block into one function.
//
// A malformed global file throws here, so it fails init exactly as loudly as
// it fails a review. That is deliberate: a scaffold silently written against
// "no global file" when there IS one, broken, would hardcode into the repo
// file precisely the keys the operator was about to fix.

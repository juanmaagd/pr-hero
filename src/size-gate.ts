// numbers.
//
// WHY this exists, stated exactly and no wider: it is a COST AND
// PREDICTABILITY gate, NOT a quality gate. Measured on our own runs, small
// trees bill $1.9–$4.8, while the 45-file / +2775 −1237 bench tree billed
// $6.58–$17.92 across 18 iterations — the cost roughly triples AND its spread
// widens to ~2.7x, so a big tree is both expensive and unbudgetable.
//
// What this gate does NOT claim, because we measured it and it is not true:
// that a bigger diff reviews WORSE. Attention dilution was tested and
// falsified in fixtures/scale-probe.ts, and the one measured Greptile-only
// miss came from a 7-file PR. Nothing here — comment, message or flag help —
// may imply otherwise.

// The shipped defaults. 1500 lines sits above the everyday PR and well below
// the bench tree that produced the cost blow-up above; 150 files is the "this
// is a mechanical sweep, not a review" ceiling.
//
// 1500 has a history, and the whole arc matters because the middle of it was
// a wrong diagnosis. 1500 shipped first, extrapolated from "everything
// measured cheap was under 830 lines". Then this repo's own PR #1 (1603
// lines) printed `size gate: SKIP` and a $3.18-6.86 cost band in the same
// breath — the gate refusing, on cost grounds, a diff whose cost was
// ordinary. The conclusion drawn at the time was "the limit is too tight",
// and it was raised to 2500.
//
// That was treating the symptom. The real cause was that the gate was
// counting lines it was not actually filtering out of the bill:
//   - F001 — the exclusion list shrank the GATE's count but not the diff
//     handed to the hunters, so an excluded lockfile was still paid for in
//     full. The count and the bill were two different numbers.
//   - whitespace — a formatter sweep consumed budget it costs nothing to
//     review, because the count was taken from a plain `--numstat`.
// With both fixed (the reviewed diff IS the filtered diff, and the gate
// counts from `git diff -w --ignore-blank-lines`), the number the gate
// measures is the number that gets paid for, and 1500 is a real 1500. So it
// stands, and 2500 is retired.
//
// The band 830..4000 is still unmeasured. If a diff in it ever bills like the
// bench tree, this number is the thing to revisit — with a measurement, not
// another extrapolation.
//
// The exclusion list is generated-content only: lockfiles, minified bundles
// and jest-style snapshots are enormous, mechanical, and nothing a hunter can
// usefully read. Excluding them keeps the gate from firing on a PR whose real
// change is ten lines beside a regenerated lockfile.

//

// this function's output, which makes it literally what the hunters saw, and

// a `diff --git ` header at column 0 starts a record and everything up to the

// surface's pure half (ui.ts formats, ui-select.ts asks, this one reports):
// same contract as both — everything is a total function of its inputs, the
// style flag and the width arrive as PARAMETERS, and the I/O shell in cli.ts
// owns the printing and every exit code.
//
// WHY it exists at all: this block was written TWICE, once at the end of
// local mode and once at the end of PR mode, with different label padding and
// a `posted:` line that duplicated one already printed during the run. Two
// copies of the last thing an operator reads is two chances to drift, and
// neither copy could be tested because both were a run of `log()` calls
// inside a 400-line async shell. The mode-specific parts (comparison,
// worktree hint, extra artifacts) are optional inputs, not a second renderer.
//
// WHY it prints the FINDINGS: after five minutes and $4 the terminal used to
// report counts and file paths and never once said what was found — the
// payload was the one thing you had to leave the terminal to read. Everything
// below the header exists to end that.

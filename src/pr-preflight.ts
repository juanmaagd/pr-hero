// HTML comment attribute has the identical exposure: it can contain spaces,
// `=`, `--`, or bytes that break naive re-parsing of the marker's own fields.
// Percent-encoding removes the ambiguity at the source — the SAME reason
// resolveNumstatPath/diffRecordPath route every path through unquotePath —
// rather than adding another ad-hoc unescaper that could drift from the

// treat a marker with a mismatched or absent `c` as parseable — matching on
// it is inline.ts's business, not this parser's.

// issue comments post to the same PR), and a matcher that could mistake one

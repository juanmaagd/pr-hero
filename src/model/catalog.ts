// #175, 2026-09-02. This catalogue holds ALIAS NAMES and nothing else.
//
// WHY it used to hold more, and why that was the last version pin in the
// system: every alias carried `modelFamily`/`modelSnapshot` (`sonnet` ->
// `claude-sonnet-5`). That pin never decided what RAN — `spawnModelForClaudeCli`
// sends the bare alias on a `direct` gateway and the Claude CLI resolves it
// itself (verified live 2026-09-02: `--model sonnet` ran `claude-sonnet-5`).
// It decided only what we ASSERTED had run, in `ResolvedModelRoute`, the route
// fingerprint and `pipeline.json`. So the day Anthropic repointed an alias,
// the CLI would run the new model and our provenance artifact would state the
// old snapshot — a false statement about what ran, in the artifact whose only
// job is to say what ran, arrived at silently. And every model release became
// a release of ours.
//
// WHAT SURVIVES, and why it is legitimately ours: the alias LIST. That
// `sonnet|opus|haiku` are accepted as bare model names is a pr-hero UX
// convention. What they resolve to is the provider's business, and a wrong
// name now fails AT THE PROVIDER — an error from the party that knows is more
// honest than a mapping of ours that pretends to.
//
// The operator can still pin: a routing config's `modelSnapshot` is passed
// through verbatim (model/routing.ts) and reaches `--model` on a `configured`
// gateway. Pinning is a decision an operator makes per run, not a constant we
// ship.

// WHY the engine owns this at all (#299, 2026-10-02): pr-hero never passed
// `--effort`, so every step ran at the CLI's implicit default, which is `high`
// except on Sonnet 5.5 and Opus 5.5, where it is `medium`
// (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config). When the `sonnet` alias moved
// to 5.5 the hunters silently dropped a level and stopped exploring.
//
// Measured on musive pr-1858 (Sonnet 5.5, 4 hunters x 2 replicates):
//   medium 0/8 runs with findings (0.5 min), high 6/8 (1.5 min),
//   xhigh 8/8 and all 4 known bugs (4.5 min), max 7/8 (19 min).
//   - hunter  xhigh: the cheapest level that found everything.
//   - refuter high: refuter-probe 16/16 at medium was NOT sufficient. On the
//     real pr-1858 xhigh findings the Opus refuter at medium returned
//     `refuted` on the pre-labeled known `updateProject` BLOCKER in 3 of 4
//     verdicts, which deletes it; at high it was `downgraded-latent` (kept, as
//     advisory) in 3 of 4 and refuted in 1 of 4. The other 5 findings got the
//     same verdicts at both levels, and the original Sonnet-5-at-high refuter
//     corroborated that finding. The cost is a refuter leg of ~140s instead of
//     ~90s. The probe plants claims with a known verdict; it cannot see a
//     real finding being talked out of existence, which is what this gate did.
//   - everything else high: unmeasured, so it keeps what every model ran at
//     before the 5.5 family, i.e. the behavior those roles were validated under.

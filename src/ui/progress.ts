// \x1b[?25l would need a restore on every exit path, and a leaked hidden
// cursor wrecks the user's terminal — a visible cursor over a redrawing
// panel is fine.

// Two things the tree made load-bearing that a fixed-height list did not:
//   - the height budget, recomputed EVERY draw (a mid-run resize must tighten
//     it on the next tick, not walk the cursor off the top of the screen);

//     lines were impossible; a tree that collapses a finished branch shrinks,
//     and without the erase-to-end the previous frame's tail stays on screen
//     as orphaned rows.
// Exported for its test, which is the only consumer outside this module: the
// post-stop silence below is a CRITICAL invariant and an untested one regresses.

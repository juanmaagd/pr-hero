// The ledger has no equivalent hand-off to the SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers (which
// settle only the commit status, via holdCommitStatusLock). Any throw or
// early return that skipped explicit settlement lands here — checked in BOTH
// finally blocks below, because the outer one must also catch a throw from
// inside the inner finally itself (e.g. settleCiAdmissionLedger rejecting
// after the status publish).
//
// `settle` is a test-only seam (default: the real settleCiAdmissionLedger):
// admission.ts is out of scope for this slice and its ledger persist call
// has no spawnFn of its own, so offline tests inject a fake here instead of
// touching that module. Every production caller omits it.

// The inner `finally`: the commit status must settle BEFORE the lock is
// released, and the release must happen no matter which path — throw, early
// return, or normal exit — got here. Do not wrap
// tryPublishCommitStatus/releaseCommitStatusLock in their own try/finally
// "for safety": today a throw from tryPublishCommitStatus skips the release,
// and preserving that (not "fixing" it) is this function's job.
//
// `spawnFn` threads into tryPublishCommitStatus (status.ts's own seam,
// invisible to production): this doubles the real `gh` boundary instead of
// replacing tryPublishCommitStatus's swallow-errors behavior with a fake,
// so a test can prove that behavior for real — a failed gh post still lets
// this function release the lock and settle the ledger, exactly as a
// successful one does. `settle` stays a whole-function seam (default: the
// real settleCiAdmissionLedger): admission.ts is out of scope for this
// slice and its ledger persist call has no spawnFn of its own.

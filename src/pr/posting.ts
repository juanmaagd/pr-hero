// PR mode's inline-posting stage: publish the review as PR comments, only
// when asked. Relocated out of reviewPr() (src/pr/review-pr.ts): the
// `postEnabled` branch became an early return and identifiers moved onto
// explicit parameters, control flow otherwise unchanged. The WHY comments
// below move with the code they explain.
//
// Runs AFTER the Greptile comparison on purpose: a posting failure must
// never cost the comparison artifact. And unlike the comparison, posting
// does NOT degrade to a warning — it was explicitly requested. Goes through
// the inline surface — anchorability, cross-run matching, the one review
// submission (with its 422 recovery into the summary Outside Diff bucket).
// `postInlineIfEligible` carries the `sessionFailed` guard (design D6,
// spec "sessionFailed suppresses all posting"): a clean-bill comment set
// from a review that never ran would be a public lie, same reasoning as the
// comparison guard in comparison.ts.

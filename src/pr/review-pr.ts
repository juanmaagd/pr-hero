// PR mode (ROADMAP B1): one command from a PR number to a reviewed range, a
// detached worktree, a pipeline run, and a Greptile comparison. Moved out of
// src/cli.ts (cli-decomp Phase 2, odd/tasks/cli-decomposition.md) as a
// byte-for-byte relocation — no behaviour change.
//
// Two roots run through everything below, and confusing them is the failure
// this design exists to prevent:
//   - the OPERATOR root: --repo's toplevel. cwd for gh and for .prhero/
//     config+gotchas. Config is NEVER read from the worktree — the operator
//     checkout is the trust anchor, and a reviewed PR's tree must not
//     influence engine config. Dirtiness here is irrelevant.
//   - the GIT-DIR OWNER: the clone registered for this origin under
//     ~/.prhero/repos/<id>/registry.json. Fetch, worktree add/prune/remove
//     and the object-db git (rev-parse, diff) run against it, because
//     `git worktree add` is bound to one git dir (W3 / #24).
//   - the REVIEW root: the worktree, detached at the PR's head, living
//     under ~/.prhero/repos/<id>/worktrees/pr-<n>. The pipeline's cwd, the
//     tree the codegraph checks run against, and a root the run dir must
//     stay outside of.

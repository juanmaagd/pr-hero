// WHY this module-level state exists (paid for on PR #162, 2026-09-01): a run
// cancelled by the workflow's `cancel-in-progress` concurrency group posted its
// pending on the head it was legitimately reviewing and then never settled it,
// because the SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers end in `process.exit()` — which skips
// reviewPr's `finally`. The next run read that pending back through
// isInFlightCommitStatus, saw a lock younger than the 90-minute TTL, and
// skipped: PR #162 went unreviewed while the `review` job still reported
// success.
//
// The lock cannot tell "another process is working" from "a dead process left
// this behind" — it is a cross-machine TOCTOU guard, not a liveness probe. So
// the fix is on the holder's side: the process that took the lock releases it
// on the way out. This closes the CANCELLATION case, which is by far the most
// common one, because `cancel-in-progress: true` on a head-ref concurrency
// group fires on EVERY push, not only a force-push. A runner that dies with no
// signal at all (hard kill, OOM, a dropped machine) still reaches nothing here
// and remains covered only by the TTL.
//
// Module state, and the same precedent as `unregisterActiveRun(process.pid)`:
// a signal handler installed in runCli cannot see reviewPr's scope, so what it
// needs has to be parked where both can reach it.

// Settles the pending this process is holding, then exits — the caller is a

//
// Take-and-clear BEFORE the await, not after: Actions cancels with SIGINT and
// follows with SIGTERM before the grace period ends, so both handlers can be
// in flight at once and a peek-then-post would settle twice. `post` is a seam
// only so the take-and-clear and the bound below are testable offline.
//
// Every error is swallowed on purpose. Failing to settle leaves us exactly
// where PR #162 left us — never worse — and a throw here would cost the exit
// code the handler owes the runner.

// replacing the whole function with a fake that can only assert it was
// called, not what it really does when gh fails.

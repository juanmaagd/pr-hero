// PR mode's Greptile head-to-head, in-process. Relocated out of reviewPr()
// (src/pr/review-pr.ts): the two sequential `if/else` blocks collapsed into
// one early-return guard clause, identifiers renamed to explicit parameters,
// control flow otherwise unchanged. The WHY comments below move with the
// code they explain.
//
// A failure here must NOT fail the run: the review artifacts are already on
// disk and are the product, so a gh hiccup degrades to a warning, never an
// exit code. A run where EVERY hunter died writes no comparison at all —
// "pr-hero 0" from a review that never happened would land in B4's ledger as
// a measured miss, and the ledger's honesty outranks the artifact's
// completeness.

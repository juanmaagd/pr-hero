// #133. WHICH credential a route runs on, decided from the backend AND the
// provider. Backend alone is not enough: OpenCode serves exactly one provider
// from a subscription (OPENCODE_OAUTH_PROVIDER) and everything else from a
// metered API token, and those are different credentials with different
// billing, different projection payloads and different rate-limit buckets.
//
// This is deliberately PROVIDER-KEYED and deliberately does NOT read the
// credential store. The bounded, known limit that buys: an `openai` entry
// holding an API key rather than an OAuth record still resolves to
// `opencode_chatgpt_oauth` here, and is then refused by the OAuth broker's
// existing `type !== "oauth"` lock (credential-broker.ts). That is a loud
// failure with a one-line fix, not a silent metered run. Reading the store
// here to disambiguate would put a credential read inside a pure routing
// decision, and would make the answer depend on machine state the frozen
// plan cannot record.
//
// WHY the default is `provider_api_token` rather than the subscription kind:
// metered is the FAIL-CLOSED direction. A metered route with no pricing is
// refused at the exact-binding gate (`pricing_table_missing`, blocking), so
// the cost of guessing metered is a refusal. A route wrongly marked
// subscription EXECUTES and reports `cashCostUsd: 0` over real spend — the
// cost of guessing subscription is an unmetered bill nobody sees.
//
// #161 (corrected 2026-09-24 by Juanma — the first cut of this inverted
// precedence and is wrong; read this in full before touching the
// claude-code branch again). The kind must answer "what will the CHILD
// actually run on?", not "does env carry a key?" in isolation — those two
// questions only agree when NOTHING will project a credential.
//
// When a broker IS attached and its projection SUCCEEDS, the harness strips
// ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN and CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN from
// the child's env, whatever the ambient environment carries
// (`PROJECTION_OWNED_KEYS`, execution/harness.ts — "a projection owns the
// CREDENTIAL IDENTITY, not just the home"). So a macOS developer with an
// exported `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, running through the darwin Keychain default,
// spawns a child that never sees that key — it runs on the projected
// subscription OAuth record. Calling that route metered (the first cut's
// mistake) would silently rebill a subscription developer as per-token for a
// key the child structurally cannot spend.
//
// KNOWN EXCEPTION — #279 (fixed 2026-09-24 by Juanma, option 2: fence at the
// harness, admission stays unchanged). `KeychainCredentialBroker.project` can
// throw `missing_subscription_record` when the CLI moved its OAuth record
// out of the Keychain item; the harness DEGRADES that one failure class
// instead of killing the step (harness.ts ~756-778) — no projection runs,
// `buildChildEnv` returns the env UNSTRIPPED, and an ambient key reaches the
// child after all. On that path THIS FUNCTION still says subscription (a
// broker WAS attached) — that answer is deliberately left unchanged, because
// admission cannot know at bind time whether a projection will degrade — but
// the spend is no longer unaccounted for: `StepExecutionHarness.run`
// (harness.ts) now recognizes its OWN degraded projection, re-applies this
// SAME `envBillsMetered` predicate to the SAME unstripped child env usage
// filing reads, and reserves+fences that one attempt against the spend
// ledger as if the route had bound metered — without changing the kind this
// function returns, which credential runs, or who pays. Pre-existing: before
// #161 every claude-code route said subscription regardless, so this exact
// admission/filing mismatch already existed on every degraded projection;
// #161 did not create it, and this function still does not resolve it — the
// harness does, downstream of here.
//
// `hasBroker` carries "will a broker ATTEMPT to project" — a plain boolean
// the CALLER already resolved (`resolveBindingAuthority` below constructs
// the broker first, unconditionally, exactly as before #161 existed). This
// function stays pure: no platform check, no fs/network probe of whether
// that attempt will actually SUCCEED — #279 is precisely the runtime state
// this function cannot see and does not try to.
//
// `env` is the raw, PRE-strip environment (`options.env ?? process.env` at
// the call site), not the post-strip child env. On a SUCCESSFUL projection,
// `!hasBroker && envBillsMetered(env)` equals `envBillsMetered(postStripEnv)`
// — matching usage filing's own `envBillsMetered(request.isolation.env)`
// (claude-code-cli.ts) by construction. #279 is the one path where that
// equality breaks.
//
// Both arguments default to the "nothing is known" case (`env: {}`,
// `hasBroker: false`) so a caller that omits them — every existing call site
// that never threaded either through, and every test that does not care
// about this dimension — keeps today's answer: subscription.
